# Server Restart Required

The styling issues have been fixed! To see the changes:

1. **Stop the current server**:
   - Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where the server is running

2. **Start the server again**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Refresh your browser** at http://localhost:3000

The application should now display with proper styling including:
- Modern UI with Tailwind CSS
- Styled buttons and components
- Proper layout and spacing
- File upload area with drag-and-drop styling
- Professional header and navigation

If you still don't see styles after restarting, try:
- Hard refresh the browser (Ctrl + Shift + R)
- Clear browser cache
- Check the browser console for any errors
